# ðŸ“¦ SQL Data Warehouse Project

Welcome to my **Data Warehouse project**, where I demonstrate my full potential in **data engineering** â€” from raw data to actionable insights.

In this project, Iâ€™ve designed and implemented a complete end-to-end solution, simulating a **real-world business use case**. It includes:

-  **Architecture Design** â€” Bronze, Silver, Gold data layers  
-  **ETL/ELT Pipelines** â€” Data extraction, transformation, and loading  
-  **Data Modeling** â€” Star schema with dimension and fact tables  
-  **Advanced SQL Analytics** â€” Complex queries for business KPIs  
-  **Power BI Dashboard** *(optional, if included)*  
-  **Documentation & Optimization** â€” Indexing, partitioning, best practices

This project reflects my hands-on ability to build scalable and efficient data systems.  
I'm excited to share it with you and hope it serves as a strong example of my capabilities! ðŸš€
