Welcome to my Data Warehouse project, where I demonstrate my full potential in data engineering — from raw data to actionable insights.

In this project, I’ve designed and implemented a complete end-to-end solution, simulating a real-world business use case. It includes:

🔹 Architecture Design — Bronze, Silver, Gold data layers
🔹 ETL/ELT Pipelines — Data extraction, transformation, and loading
🔹 Data Modeling — Star schema with dimension and fact tables
🔹 Advanced SQL Analytics — Complex queries for business KPIs
🔹 Power BI Dashboard — (Optional: if you're adding visualization)
🔹 Documentation & Optimization — Indexing, partitioning, best practices

This project reflects my hands-on ability to build scalable and efficient data systems.
I'm excited to share it with you and hope it serves as a strong example of my capabilities! 🚀
